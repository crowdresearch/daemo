              Vishwajeet Narwal is a Undergrad. student from Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, LNMIIT.

In summer,2014, He worked as research intern at NIT Kurukshetra under Dr Mahesh Pal on applications of sparse learning algorithms in field of remote sensing. Some of the algorithms investigated during this work includes ELM, Sparse ELM, Sparse Bayesian ELM, multiclass RUM, Probabilistic vector Machines, L2DWK ensembles, HERF etc. He also worked on incorporating Particle Swarm Optimisation to tune kernel parameters and regularisation constant of  Sparse kernelled ELM.
Apart from Machine Learning, He has significant work experience in DIP, especially in Interpolation and noise removal algorithms.
Currently He is associated with Clarity Lab at University of Michigan regarding development of Opne Source Intelligent Personal Assistant named Sirius.
