# Crowdsource Platform - Crowdresearch HCI Stanford

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform)


This is a Django 1.9 app using a Postgres database 9.4 that can be deployed to Heroku.

## Setup

[Please follow the GitHub tutorial](http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu/w/index.php?title=BranchingStrategy) to setup the repository.

If you are on Windows or want a simpler (automatic) setup process, please try the instructions in the [Setup with Vagrant](#setup-with-vagrant) section. Solutions to common errors can found on the [FAQ page](http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu/w/index.php?title=FAQs)

#### Databases
Install [Postgres](http://postgresapp.com/) 9.4+ and create a new database:

    bash> psql
    psql> CREATE DATABASE crowdsource_dev ENCODING 'UTF8';

Create a `local_settings.py` file in the project root folder by copying `local_settings_default.py` and configure it to connect to your local Postgres database:

    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
            "NAME": "crowdsource_dev"
        }
    }

Install [Redis](http://redis.io/download) key-value store used for managing sessions, cache and web-sockets support.

#### Backend Dependencies
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Test this by opening a command line terminal and typing `python'.

Install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) to manage a local setup of your python packages. Go into the directory with the checkout of the code and create the Python virtual environment:

    bash> virtualenv venv

Source the virtual environment, install dependencies, and migrate the database:

    bash> source venv/bin/activate
    bash> pip install -r local_requirements.txt
    bash> python manage.py migrate

If this is your first time setting it up, you need to initialize your migrations and database:

    bash> python manage.py makemigrations
    bash> python manage.py migrate

#### Frontend Dependencies
Install node.js. If you have a Mac, we recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Then:

    bash> brew install node

For Ubuntu or Debian:

    bash> sudo apt-get update
    bash> sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy npm

Now, you can install the dependencies, which are managed by a utility called Bower:

    bash> npm install -g bower
    bash> npm install
    bash> bower install

If there are no errors, you are ready to run the app from your local server:

    bash> python manage.py runserver

#### Grunt Toolchain with LiveReload
As an alternative, using grunt toolchain, you can start the server as below.
This will auto-compile SCSS using [LibSass](http://libsass.org/) and reload when changes happen for frontend.
For LiveReload, please visit [how do I install Live Reload and use the browser extensions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-) for your browser.
Pep8 styling issues will be identified for any python script modifications and notified in console.
Port 8000 is used by default. If it is already in use, please modify it in Gruntfile.js

    bash> grunt serve
    
#### uWSGI and Web-Sockets Support
Create a `uwsgi-dev.ini` file in the project root folder by copying `uwsgi-dev-default.ini`
If there are no errors, you are ready to run the app from your local server:

    bash> uwsgi uwsgi-dev.ini

#### HTTPS mode
To serve the local site over https, a sample certificate and key are provided in the repo. 
To start it, first disable http mode in `uwsgi-dev.ini` by adding `;` in front of
    
    http-socket = :8000
    
Now enable https mode by removing `;` in front of 
    
    ;https = :8000,cacert.pem,private_key.pem,HIGH
    
use this command instead of the ```runserver``` command above:

    bash> uwsgi uwsgi-dev.ini

This uses the ```uwsgi``` server, which is used in production as well.

And you can visit the website by going to https://127.0.0.1:8000 in your web browser.

You will see a untrusted certificate message in most modern browsers. For this site (and this site only), you may ignore this warning and proceed to the site.

#### Background Jobs with Celery
To run celery locally: `celery -A csp worker -l info -B`

## Setup with Vagrant
We do not guarantee that this will work for all machines under Windows, it is up to you to make it work, we highly recommend using Linux or OS X.

This approach might be useful if you're on Windows or have trouble setting up postgres, python, nodejs, git, etc. It will run the server in a virtual machine.

First install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

If you are on Windows, you should also install [Git](http://msysgit.github.io/). During the setup process, select "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" (on the "Adjusting your PATH environment" page), and "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" (on the "Configuring the line ending conversions" page).

Clone this repo to get the code:

    git clone https://github.com/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform.git
    cd crowdsource-platform

Then run the command:

    vagrant up

This will set up an Ubuntu VM, install prerequisites, create databases, and start the machine. Then run:

    vagrant ssh

This will now give you a shell in your virtual machine.  It will automatically cd to /home/vagrant/crowdsource-platform where the code is (this is a shared folder with the host machine)

Now you can run the server:

    python manage.py runserver [::]:8000

And you can visit the website by going to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Refer to HTTPS mode section for running instance in secure mode.

On subsequent runs, you only need to run:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    python manage.py runserver [::]:8000
    
## Setup with Heroku

Every PR should be that does something substantial (i.e. not a README change) must be accompanied with a live demo of the platform. To spin up your own heroku instance, you can sign up for an account for free and follow instructions found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).

After setting up your own heroku instance, setup the build-packs for the instance by executing below commands in same order:

    heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs.git
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-pgbouncer

To verify build-packs are setup correctly, execute below replacing <app-name>:

    heroku buildpacks --app <app-name>

This should output build-pack URLs as below in same order (nodejs should appear first compared to python):

    === Buildpack URLs
    1. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-pgbouncer.git
    2. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs.git
    3. https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git
    
Make sure you have Heroku-Postgres and Heroku-Redis Add-ons installed on the instance.    

Use this command to deploy your branch to that instance.

    git push heroku yourbranch:master

For setting environ variables, use below

    heroku config:set <variable>=<value>

For instance, to enable Registration,

    heroku config:set REGISTRATION_ALLOWED=True

and to disable Registration,

    heroku config:unset REGISTRATION_ALLOWED
