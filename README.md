# Crowdsource Platform - Crowdresearch HCI Stanford

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform)


This is a Django 1.8 app using a Postgres database that can be deployed to Heroku.

### Setup

If you are on Windows or want a simpler (automatic) setup process, please try the instructions in the [Setup with Vagrant](#setup-with-vagrant) section. Solutions to common errors can found on the [FAQ page](http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu/w/index.php?title=FAQs)

Install [Postgres](http://postgresapp.com/) and create a new database:

    bash> psql
    psql> CREATE DATABASE crowdsource_dev ENCODING 'UTF8';

Create a `local_settings.py` file in the project root folder and configure it to connect to the Postgres database:

    DATABASES = {
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
            "NAME": "crowdsource_dev"
        }
    }

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Test this by opening a command line terminal and typing `python'. 

Install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) to manage a local setup of your python packages. Go into the directory with the checkout of the code and create the Python virtual environment:

    bash> virtualenv venv

Source the virtual environment, install dependencies, and migrate the database:

    bash> source venv/bin/activate
    bash> pip install -r requirements.txt
    bash> python manage.py makemigrations oauth2_provider
    bash> python manage.py migrate

If this is your first time setting it up, you need to initialize your migrations and database:

    bash> python manage.py makemigrations
    bash> python manage.py migrate

If you instead have a database but do not have migrations:

    bash> python manage.py makemigrations crowdsourcing
    bash> python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
    
Install node.js. If you have a Mac, we recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Then:

    bash> brew install node
    
For Ubuntu or Debian:

    bash> sudo apt-get update
    bash> sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy npm
    
Now, you can install the dependencies, which are managed by a utility called Bower:

    bash> npm install -g bower
    bash> bower install

If you encounter an error `angular-route.js 404`, do this:

    bash> bower cache clean
    bash> rm -fr staticfiles/bower_components
    bash> bower install
    
If there are no errors, you are ready to run the app from your local server:

    bash> python manage.py runserver
    
Where can I get data?
1) Current file: following data supports tasksearch, task, ranking  
    
    bash> python manage.py loaddata fixtures/neilTaskRankingData.json

OPTIONAL
2) Ranking Dataset  (>800 records already included in #1)

    bash> python manage.py loaddata fixtures/neilCrowdsourcingRankingData.json
 
3) Optional to dump data from environment to the file
   bash> python manage.py dumpdata crowdsourcing > fixtures/neilCrowdsourcingRankingData.json
    
4) How to generate data dynamically with autofixture 

    bash> python manage.py loadtestdata AppName.Model:NUMBER OF RECORDS  
    Example: bash> python manage.py loadtestdata crowdsourcing.UserCountry:15

### Setup with Vagrant

This approach might be useful if you're on Windows or have trouble setting up postgres, python, nodejs, git, etc. It will run the server in a virtual machine.

First install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

If you are on Windows, you should also install [Git](http://msysgit.github.io/). During the setup process, select "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" (on the "Adjusting your PATH environment" page), and "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" (on the "Configuring the line ending conversions" page).

Clone this repo to get the code:

    git clone https://github.com/crowdresearch/crowdsource-platform.git
    cd crowdsource-platform

Then run the command:

    vagrant up

This will set up an Ubuntu VM, install prerequisites, create databases, and start the machine. Then run:

    vagrant ssh

This will now give you a shell in your virtual machine.  It will automatically cd to /home/vagrant/crowdsource-platform where the code is (this is a shared folder with the host machine)

Now you can run the server:

    python manage.py runserver [::]:8000

And you can visit the website by going to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

On subsequent runs, you only need to run:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    python manage.py runserver [::]:8000
